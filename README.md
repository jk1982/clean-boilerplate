# clean-boilerplate
A personal clean-boilerplate web api

This is a personal repository for a Clean Web API with JWT authentication and autorization, email confirmantio and bla bla bla. 

In addition, I'm using:

- Fluent Validation
- Serilog
- Dapper
- Sendgrid

This is a simple architecture. I'm pointing to a Postgres server, but it's easy to change the database.
PS: I'm not using blackbox solutions, like EF, but you can attach one of these pandora boxes easely using a "hexagonal/ports and adapters" architecture.

Final words: It's not 100%, for sure. I'm aggregating more tools im my private repository and suddenly I'll increase this repo too. But it's functional ... and SIMPLE!
