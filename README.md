# clean-boilerplate
A personal clean-boilerplate web api

This is a personal repository for a Clean Web API with JWT authentication and autorization, email confirmantio, etc. 

Below is a partial list about this project stack:

- Hexagonal Architecture :heart:
- Fluent Validation
- Serilog
- Dapper
- Sendgrid

The storage layer is based on Postgres, but is easy to change to any other database tool using this architecture.

PS: I'm not using any blackbox solution, but you can attach one easely bc I'm using "hexagonal/ports and adapters" architecture!
